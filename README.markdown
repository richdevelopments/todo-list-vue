# TODO List Vue.js
  
  I created this small TODO List application using Vue.js. You first type a number of TODOs, then press enter. It will then create that many items in a list numbered 1 to which ever number you entered. Click save and the order gets printed in the console.
  You can then click on each todo item and edit the name with any name you want. 
  You can then drag each item and put them in any order. Click save and it will save the list in that order and print that order to the console.

  You can see a live demo here -
